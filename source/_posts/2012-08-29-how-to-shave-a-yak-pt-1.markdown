(... an hour and a half of setting up Octopress later ...)

A new blog is always a hopeful endeavor, isn't it? Shining with wide-eyed
optimism at the prospect of disciplined posting schedules and ever-mounting
readership.

Well. I don't much expect anyone to find their way here except by Googling for
an error message and finding this by accident. I intend to post about the
technical problems I have on a daily basis developing and deploying software. I
just wanted a place to put my notes that wasn't [my personal weblog](http://iconocla.st/).

_Insh'allah_, may you find what you seek here, as I have so often found what I
sought across the many poorly-written forum posts and antiquated blog entries
that span the wond'rous Internet. _Ave atque vale_, fellow traveller.
