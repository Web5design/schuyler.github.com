    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(... an hour and a half of setting up Octopress later ...)</p>

<p>A new blog is always a hopeful endeavor, isn't it? Shining with wide-eyed
optimism at the prospect of disciplined posting schedules and ever-mounting
readership.</p>

<p>Well. I don't much expect anyone to find their way here except by Googling for
an error message and finding this by accident. I intend to post about the
technical problems I have on a daily basis developing and deploying software. I
just wanted a place to put my notes that wasn't <a href="http://iconocla.st/">my personal weblog</a>.</p>

<p><em>Insh'allah</em>, may you find what you seek here, as I have so often found what I
sought across the many poorly-written forum posts and antiquated blog entries
that span the wond'rous Internet. <em>Ave atque vale</em>, fellow traveller.</p>
